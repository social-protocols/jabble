# The Social Network of the Future

We are in the process of creating a social network based on what we've learned from our experiments during the past years.
The core of our concepts is the [Global Brain Algorithm](https://social-protocols.org/global-brain), which converts a social network into a distributed brain, resulting in a whole that is more intelligent than the individual human parts.
