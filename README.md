# Large Scale Collective Intelligence

We are in the process of creating a large scale collective intelligence system
based on what we've learned from our experiments during the past years. The core
of our concepts is the
[Global Brain Algorithm](https://social-protocols.org/global-brain), which
converts a social network into a distributed brain, resulting in a whole that is
more intelligent than the individual human parts.
